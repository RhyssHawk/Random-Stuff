Zombie Game Version 2

Thought I could improve upon the first Version of the zombie game, so I gave it a shot.

Some of the things added/changed:
 - Less disabling buttons
 - Generation of zombies with random stats
 - Zombies have 0 to 3 weaknesses to certain weapons, which deal double damage against them
 - Zombies have three random attacks
 - Loot tables created to make the most powerful items rarer
 - Randomly generated names for the player and Zombies
 - Cleaner code, though still a bit of a mess
 - Overhauled GUI with player stats to the right hand side and game info at the bottom
 - Color scheme changed to shades of gray. Looks way better than plain White on Black.

Considered adding a map with clickable buttons to move instead of a dropdown menu, but not sure how to
do that with AppJar, and the first couple of attempts failed so I stuck with the old drop down menu. Could change later on.
