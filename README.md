# Random-Stuff

Random stuff I've created to improve programming skills.

Most of the stuff here has something to do with Minecraft, as that's what I spent a lot of my time doing, so learning
these skills enhanced my experience and allowed me to create things that made the Quality of Life a lot better.

Also other misc things like the Zombie Game that was initially a school assignment, but I went back and redid them as a challenge.
