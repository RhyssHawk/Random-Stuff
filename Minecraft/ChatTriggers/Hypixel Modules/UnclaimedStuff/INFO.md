Random Module I made that has a bunch of useful things for Hypixel.

 - Added a SettingsManager settings menu.
 - Promote guild members automatically via the gui.
 - One-Line Dungeons Info (Completions, Cata level, secrets found, best times).
 - One-Line Guild command (Guild experience, rank, guild info).
 - Generate a player's exact name with colors via data from Hypixel's /player API.
 - Paste names into chat to kick/demote them (eg /gk player1 player2 etc) - Never got around to automating.
