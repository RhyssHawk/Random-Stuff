MultiChat Module essentially allows you to see the Guild chat of an online alt account while playing on your main account, essentially letting you be in two
guilds at the same time.
You can send commands and chat messages via your main account to your alt in the same style as Hypixel's chat channels (eg /mc \<message>, /chat mc)
