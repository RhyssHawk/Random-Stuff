ClassicSB Module

A collection of random stuff that made life easier on the server Classic Skyblock, as well as some chat games and other features.
Made using JavaScript es5 because of how outdated ChatTriggers for 1.12.2 was.
ALL of these features were allowed on the server at the time they were created and used.

Features:
 - Help command.
 - Player tracker (Shows online staff and players around you).
 - Balance Tracker > Shows your balance on screen (Server removed feature the most recent wipe).
 - Message Filter > Hides useless or spammy messages.
 - Private Channel > Used when screensharing without a mic (Say things in chat that nobody else but you can see).
 - Chat Logs > Store everything that gets sent into chat into log files with dates, times etc.
 - Enchanter > Instantly enchant a held item with every applicable enchant.
 - Auto Congratz > It's a tradition to say "Gz" after someone donates on the server, so this does it automatically.
 - Welcome Command > Stores the name of the last player to join the server for the first time so you can type /wlc and give them a personalized welcome message
 - Prefix Replacer > Lets you change the prefixes and usernames of players in chat (Your screen only).
 - OwO Mode > Makes you talk like a furry (r's to w's etc) yeah..
 - Lottery > People pay you money in exchange for "Tickets" at 1k/ticket, and after 60 seconds a random person is picked and wins the entire pool.
 - Guesser > Asks people to pick a number between X and Y and if they get it right they win the prize.
 - Scramble > Says a word in chat which has been scrambled and the first person to message you back the unscrambled word gets the prize.
 
Island Banner Module

Made to combat the issue of players sabotaging my mob grinder while I wasn't at my computer to stop my income on the server
 - Set boundaries in which if a player walks into them, they will be instantly banned from coming onto the island again.
 - Keeps logs of who gets banned, at what time, at what date.
 - Whitelist people so they won't be flagged if they go into the boundaries (Teammates/trusted people etc).
