Second version of the Discord Bot.
Added some Skyblock related commands and started storing all of the UUID's and Usernames of the players that were processed into a .json file which would save 
time getting their names when it was needed in the future.
Didn't account for players changing their names, which caused issues at times but it still beat Version 1.
