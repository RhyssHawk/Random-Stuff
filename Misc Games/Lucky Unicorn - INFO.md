**Lucky Unicorn**

RNG-Based game using AppJar.
Start with a custom amount of money.
There are Four 'tokens' you can generate each time you click "Go". There are four possible tokens: A Unicorn ($5), Zebra ($0.50), Horse ($0.50) and a Donkey ($0).
Each go costs $1, and a random token ^ is generated, adding the respective amounts of money back into your balance.
The game ends if your balance reaches $0. There is no end goal, although that might have been a good idea, but this was more of a learning how to use Python's random library
and AppJar rather than an actual serious game.
